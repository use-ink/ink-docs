## Releases 🆕

For ink! we released [v3.0.1](https://github.com/use-ink/ink/releases/tag/v3.0.1) with
minor bugfixes. Besides that we made a number of improvements to our examples ‒ mostly to
our [upgradeable contracts examples](https://github.com/use-ink/ink-examples/tree/main/upgradeable-contracts).

For [`cargo-contract`](https://github.com/use-ink/cargo-contract) we released
[v1.1.1](https://github.com/use-ink/cargo-contract/releases/tag/v1.1.1) and
[v1.2.0](https://github.com/use-ink/cargo-contract/releases/tag/v1.2.0)
with bug fixes, a new sub-command `decode`, and improved support for the `call` and
`instantiate` sub-commands.

For tutorials, development and testing we recommend using our
[`substrate-contracts-node`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-contracts-node).
We issued the release [v0.13.0](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-contracts-node/releases/tag/v0.13.0),
which is in sync with a recent Substrate `master` (see the release notes for the specific commit hash).
Pre-built binaries for the release are available for Linux and Mac.

## Community Badges 🙌

We've added two versions of a community badge.

If you have a public repository with an ink! contract it would be awesome
if you could add one of those!

## Team Retreat in Athens 🇬🇷

We ‒ the developers working on ink!, Substrate's [`pallet-contracts`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/frame/contracts),
and the [Contracts UI](https://github.com/use-ink/contracts-ui) ‒
went on a team retreat in April. We discussed our roadmap for the rest
of this year, as well as some technical designs of how we want to implement
e.g. XCM in ink!. We're normally working across different time zones, with
some of us embracing the digital nomad lifestyle. Hence it was very
productive to gather together for a week.

We also did a little hackathon to do some dog-fooding: we've built a
dApp that makes use of all components by the above teams. We plan
to open source it soon, stay tuned for that 😎.

There's a lot on the horizon and we're enthusiastic about the rest of this year!

## Spanish Twitter Space 🐦

[Hernando](https://github.com/hcastano) was a guest at the spanish Polkadot
Twitter Space. The space has been recorded: https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1MnGnkgmNdBJO.

## StackExchange Public Beta

The [Substrate & Polkadot StackExchange](https://substrate.stackexchange.com/) site
has graduated from its private beta ‒ the site is now in public beta!

This means that the site is now indexed by search engines and can be
browser without any user account.

If you have any questions regarding ink! or smart contracts on Substrate this is
the place to be.

## Canvas Update

You may know that we were working on a common good smart contracts parachain
named Canvas. We've decided to put this project on hold. This gives us more
room to make ink! and the [`pallet-contracts`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/frame/contracts)
as competitive as possible, as well as help parachain teams include those.
This is not to say that we'll never get back to Canvas, but as of right now
we're no longer working on this project.

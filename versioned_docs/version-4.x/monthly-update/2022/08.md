## Releases 🚢

We've made a couple releases this month:

* `cargo-contract` [`v1.5.0`](https://github.com/use-ink/cargo-contract/releases/tag/v1.5.0)
* ink! [`v4.0.0-alpha.1`](https://github.com/use-ink/ink/releases/tag/v4.0.0-alpha.1)
* `cargo-contract` [`v2.0.0-alpha.1`](https://github.com/use-ink/cargo-contract/releases/tag/v2.0.0-alpha.1)

Our goal is to publish the next major releases of  ink! and `cargo-contract` in October;
this will then be ink! 4.0 with an accompanying `cargo-contract` 2.0.
You can find the tracking issue for ink! 4.0 [here](https://github.com/use-ink/ink/issues/1343).

## W3F Grant 🙌

`cargo-contract` currently requires some external dependencies to be installed by users
before they can use it.
One of those is `wasm-opt`, which we use for optimizing the WebAssembly file size of
an ink! contract.

Having this tool as an external dependency is causing friction for beginners.
They have to install it manually and the process varies for each operating system.
It bloats up the `cargo-contract` installation instructions and people not following
them properly run into errors because of a missing dependency.

Luckily [@brson](https://github.com/brson) and [@aimeedeer](https://github.com/aimeedeer)
have applied for a Web3 Foundation (W3F) grant to fix exactly that for
`wasm-opt`!
They've delivered the first milestone ‒ a proof of concept ‒ this month.
You can read their summary [here](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/pull/552).

Their next milestone is the integration into `cargo-contract` which will reduce our
installation instructions by one step 🙌!

## Squink in Cambridge 🇬🇧

Some people from our team spent a week in Cambridge for a Parity
event. We can't disclose too much about it at this point, but
there'll be more information on it in a while.

We brought our mascot [Squink](../../faq/faq.md#who-is-squink) along and [Andrew](https://github.com/ascjones)
played around with his early access to DALL·E 2.
The photo below was generated by asking for Instagram posts of Squink visiting
the Corpus Christi college in Cambridge.

## Swanky 😎

The Astar team has developed a suite of tools for WebAssembly smart contract
development called Swanky!

It consists of a command-line tool and a node for easy contract development.
Read more about it in their
[Medium post](https://medium.com/astar-network/swanky-the-all-in-one-wasm-tool-50c0ed9f07a6).

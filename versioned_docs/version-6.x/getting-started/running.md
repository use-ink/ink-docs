# Run a Substrate Node

The [`substrate-contracts-node`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-contracts-node)
is a simple Substrate blockchain which is configured to include the `contracts` module.
It's a comfortable option if you want to get a quickstart.

[After successfully installing `substrate-contracts-node`](./setup.md#installing-substrate-contracts-node),
you can start a local development chain by running:

```bash
substrate-contracts-node
```

**Note:** `substrate-contracts-node` uses the `--dev` flag by default. 
You may need to specify the `--dev` flag when you want to run a development chain with another binary (e.g using the Substrate Node Template).

You can interact with your node using [the Contracts UI](https://contracts-ui.substrate.io).
Once you have the webpage open, you have to configure the UI to connect to the locally running node:

- Click on the dropdown selector at the top left corner.
- Choose "Local Node".

# Setup

In case you are looking for a guided tutorial directed
towards beginners please check out our [Guided Tutorial](https://docs.substrate.io/tutorials/smart-contracts/).

## Rust & Cargo

A pre-requisite for compiling smart contracts is to have a stable Rust version and Cargo installed. Here's [an installation guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html).

## ink! CLI

The first tool we will be installing is [`cargo-contract`](https://github.com/use-ink/cargo-contract),
a CLI tool for helping setting up and managing WebAssembly smart contracts written with ink!.

You can find it [here on GitHub](https://github.com/use-ink/cargo-contract)
and [here on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-contract).

The tool has a number of handy capabilities:

```
$ cargo contract       
Utilities to develop Wasm smart contracts

Usage: cargo contract <COMMAND>

Commands:
  new          Setup and create a new smart contract project
  build        Compiles the contract, generates metadata, bundles both together in a `<name>.contract` file
  check        Check that the code builds as Wasm; does not output any `<name>.contract` artifact to the `target/` directory
  test         Test the smart contract off-chain
  upload       Upload contract code
  instantiate  Instantiate a contract
  call         Call a contract
  decode       Decodes a contracts input or output data (supplied in hex-encoding)
  help         Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -h, --help     Print help information
  -V, --version  Print version information
```

### Installation

Please see the installation instructions in the `cargo-contract` repository [here](https://github.com/use-ink/cargo-contract#installation).

If everything worked, `cargo contract --help` should show you the above list of available commands.

## Installing `substrate-contracts-node`

The [substrate-contracts-node](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-contracts-node) is
a simple Substrate blockchain which is configured to include the Substrate module for
smart contract functionality â€“ the `contracts` pallet (see [How it Works](../intro/how-it-works.md) for more).
It's a comfortable option if you want to get a quickstart.

There are two ways of installing the node:

### (1) Download the Binary
This is the recommended method, you can
[download a binary from our releases page](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-contracts-node/releases)
(Linux and Mac). 

### (2) Build it yourself

Alternatively you can build the node by yourself.
This can take quite a while though!

```bash
cargo install contracts-node
```

# Overview

ink! supports three different stages of testing: unit, integration
and end-to-end tests. On this page we'll explain what the purpose
of each stage is about and how to use it.

Generally you can think of those three types of testing as a pyramid
with the top being the most elaborate test. The End-to-End (E2E)
tests at the top will test the lower layers of the pyramid as part
of them.

# Funding Programs

You want to develop a public good for the ink! ecosystem and are
looking for funding? On this page we list some pointers of where you can look.

## ink!ubator

ink!ubator is an initiative funded by the Polkadot Treasury's Bounty Program. It is designed to
kickstart the ink! ecosystem on Polkadot, Kusama, and other Substrate chains.

You can learn more [here](/ubator).

## Ecosystem Development Funds

Nearly all chains that support ink! have some sort of ecosystem development program.
We've listed [chains that support ink! here](../intro/where-to-deploy.md).

## Treasuries

A number of chains that support ink! have a treasury. In the case of Polkadot the 
treasury in on-chain with a governance process. Here, the community decides on
where to best allocate funds.

The [Polkadot](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/) and [Kusama](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/)
treasuries are examples. A number of ink! related proposals have been funded by both treasuries.

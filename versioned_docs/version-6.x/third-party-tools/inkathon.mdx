# ink!athon dApp Boilerplate

ink!athon is a starter kit for full-stack dApp development with ink! smart contracts and a React-based frontend in one place. With convenient helper scripts and a pre-configured project setup, it lets you scaffold any dApp quickly. It's developed by the same team that is behind [AZERO.ID](https://azero.id), where this boilerplate is used in production.

## Getting started

* Try out an interactive example deployment under [inkathon.xyz](https://inkathon.xyz).
* To get started with development, head over to the [ink!athon repository](https://github.com/scio-labs/inkathon) and check its README.

## Workshop Video

Get a quickstart into the boilerplate with this talk recording by [Dennis Zoma](https://twitter.com/dennis_zoma) at the sub0 Developer Conference in Lisbon 2023: **[Start Building dApps on ink!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoNLZfsd0mQ)** (46 min).

## Architecture

The starter kit is set up as a monorepo with two packages.

* `packages/contracts`: ink! smart contracts with:
  * `Greeter` example contract
  * shorthand build & deploy scripts that export metadata and contract addresses
  * pre-configured `substrate-contracts-node`
  * extensible JS/TS `scripts/` setup
* `packages/frontend`: Next.js frontend with:
  * `polkadot-js/api` & `scio-labs/use-inkathon` dependencies 
  * pre-configured to import deployments & addresses from above
  * styling with tailwindcss and/or chakra-ui
  * components for balance checking, wallet connection, network information, and sample contract interaction

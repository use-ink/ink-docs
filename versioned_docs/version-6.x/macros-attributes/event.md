Applicable on `struct` definitions.

Defines an ink! event. A contract can define multiple such ink! events.

Events can now be defined independently of contracts. The legacy syntax of events defined 
within a contract module using `#[ink(event)]` continues to be valid.

[See our section on Events](../basics/events.md) for a detailed description and examples.

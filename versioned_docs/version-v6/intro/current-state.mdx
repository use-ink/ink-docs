## 🤗 Time at Parity (2019-2024)

In 2019, ink! started out as a small project at Parity. It grew into a sophisticated
ecosystem over the years and a community did form around it.
Throughout all these years Parity continued to allocate developer resource to the
project, which is amazing!

In April 2024, ink! moved out of the Parity umbrella. Instead of one company,
it is nowadays developed and maintained by an alliance of individual developers,
companies, and community teams altogether.
You can read more on our transition out of Parity
[here](https://x.com/ink_lang/status/1783877356819783916).

We continue to work closely with Parity, we contribute code to Parity-maintained
components and regularly synchronize with Parity developers. Parity continues to
be involved in ink! as well: in late 2024 SRLabs and the Parity security team
conducted an audit of ink! v5 ([read more here](https://x.com/paritytech/status/1882492494661005760)).

## 🧑‍🔬 Exploring alternatives to WebAssembly (2023)

From ink! v1 to v5, the execution platform was Substrate's smart contracts
module [`pallet-contracts`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/master/substrate/frame/contracts/).
This pallet required the smart contracts that were uploaded to be in the WebAssembly
(Wasm) bytecode format. So ink! contracts were always compiled to a WebAssembly binary.
This could be done by invoking `cargo build`/`rustc` directly or via our CLI tool
[`cargo-contract`](https://github.com/use-ink/cargo-contract) (which executes the
Rust compiler with optimal flags for smart contracts).

As an ongoing research project Parity was always looking at alternatives to WebAssembly
for smart contract execution. Some of those investigations are
persisted in the Polkadot Forum. The forum post on [the eBPF investigation](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/ebpf-contracts-hackathon/1084)
(eBPF is used in Solana) highlights some shortcomings of WebAssembly for smart contracts.

During 2023, Parity core developer Jan Bujak ([@koute](https://github.com/koute)) did another
exploration on alternatives for WebAssembly. [His forum post](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/exploring-alternatives-to-wasm-for-smart-contracts/2434)
gives a great overview on how he landed at RISC-V and its potential.
His explorations yielded promising results and a new project
was started: [PolkaVM](https://github.com/paritytech/polkavm)
([the announcement contains more info](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/announcing-polkavm-a-new-risc-v-based-vm-for-smart-contracts-and-possibly-more/3811)).
PolkaVM is intended to be a very fast RISC-V based virtual machine. Jan
regularly shared performance benchmarks in the Polkadot Forum. Those were very
good and got community enthusiasm started.
For blockchains a very fast performance correlates with transaction throughput
and transaction costs, which implies improved scalability and reduced costs for users.
Eventually an idea emerged: move the Substrate stack in the long-term to RISC-V
instead of WebAssembly.

## 🤝 RISC-V + `pallet-revive` (2025)

As migrating the Substrate stack from WebAssembly to RISC-V is a highly complex
undertaking, it was found that smart contracts are an ideal starting point
to kick off this migration in a clearly delimited component.

Parity subsequently forked Substrate's `pallet-contracts` into a new project called
[`pallet-revive`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/master/substrate/frame/revive).
Smart contracts that are uploaded to this new pallet have to be
in the RISC-V bytecode format, and no longer in WebAssembly.

Besides the contract binary format, a number of other significant changes were
made to provide first-class support for Solidity contracts:

    * Extensive changes were made in the inner logic of the pallet to bring its behavior
    closer to the EVM (e.g. types, events, and debugging was changed to be Solidity
    compatible).

    * In the `pallet-contracts` era, the idea for Solidity compatibility was a project
    called [Solang](https://github.com/hyperledger-solang/solang/). It's a Solidity
    compiler that parses Solidity syntax and outputs WebAssembly.
    Parsing the Solidity syntax turned out to be a complex undertaking. Solidity
    as a language is also evolving and provided a moving target.<br/><br/>
    As an iteration on that approach, for `pallet-revive` Parity started a new
    project called [`revive`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/master/substrate/frame/revive/src) ᠆
    a compiler from the Solidity bytecode YUL to a RISC-V
    contract that can be executed on `pallet-revive`.
    This bytecode is more stable than the language syntax. Plus Solidity developers
    can continue to use the Solidity compiler `solc` to compile their contracts.

    * An RPC wrapper that maps Ethereum RPC's onto Substrate was created.

At the time of writing, `pallet-revive` is deployed to the Polkadot testnet Westend
(on the AssetHub parachain).
A launch on Polkadot's canary network Kusama is targeted for early Q2/25.
The Polkadot launch is targeted for Q3/25.

## 🙌 Migrating ink! to RISC-V + `pallet-revive` (currently wip)

`pallet-revive` and RISC-V are seen as the future of smart contracts in the Polkadot
ecosystem. We agree with that vision and are excited to work on making the ink! stack
ready for it!
In autumn 2024 the ink! Alliance created [a Polkadot treasury proposal](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/treasury-ink-alliance-for-a-more-successful-plaza/9692)
around this.
The Polkadot community signaled its alignment and gave us the mandate of
migrating ink! to this new stack.

Hence, v5 of ink! and `cargo-contract` are the last ones supporting `pallet-contracts`
and Wasm. We can still backport important fixes, but the coming releases (`>= v6`) will
all no longer be compatible. In case you want to create a PR for a backport, we have
v5 release branches [here](https://github.com/use-ink/ink/tree/v5.x) and [here](https://github.com/use-ink/cargo-contract/tree/v5.x.x).

The current state of this migration is that the `master` branches of
[ink!](https://github.com/use-ink/ink) and [`cargo-contract`](https://github.com/use-ink/cargo-contract)
are compatible with `polkadot-sdk` + `pallet-revive` + PolkaVM from Jan 7, 2025.
That's the date to which we've caught up so far. We are working on catching up
to present day and aim to have a pre-release 6.0.0-alpha of both ink! and
`cargo-contract` out in March 2025.

We are actively working on [this migration guide](/docs/v6/faq/migrating-from-ink-5-to-6).
All breaking changes and new features will eventually be documented there.

What has not yet been migrated is [Contracts UI](https://github.com/use-ink/contracts-ui)
and external libraries (such as [ink!athon](https://inkathon.xyz/), the
[ink! Analyzer VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ink-analyzer.ink-analyzer),
`polkadot-js`, …).
We are in contact with the maintainers of these external libraries about migrating as well.

## 💸 ink!ubator 2.0

The [ink!ubator](/inkubator) is a funding program for advancing the ink! ecosystem.
The first round of projects was completed in autumn 2024! A final summary was posted
by Toma, one of the curators, on the Polkadot Forum [here](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/final-report-of-ink-ubator/10120).

Applications for the second cohort are now open.
See [the ink!ubator 2.0 repository](https://github.com/use-inkubator/Ecosystem-Grants)
on GitHub for more details.

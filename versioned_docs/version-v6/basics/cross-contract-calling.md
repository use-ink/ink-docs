# Cross-Contract Calls

In ink! contracts it is possible to call messages and constructors of other
on-chain contracts.

There are a few approaches to performing these cross-contract calls in ink!:
1. Contract references (i.e `ContractRef`)
1. Builders (i.e `CreateBuilder` and `CallBuilder`)

Contract references can only be used for cross-contract calls to other ink! contracts.
Builders can be used to issue cross-contract calls to any RISC-V contract, such as those
written in ink! or Solidity.

## Contract References

Contract references refer to structs that are generated by the ink! code generation for the
purposes of cross-contract calls.

They give developers a type-safe way of interacting with a contract.

A downside to using them is that you need to import the contract you want to call as a
dependency of your own contract.

If you want to interact with a contract that is already on-chain you will need to use the
[`Builders`](#builders) approach instead.

### `BasicContractRef` walkthrough

We will walk through the [`cross-contract-calls`](https://github.com/use-ink/ink-examples/tree/master/cross-contract-calls)
example in order to demonstrate how cross-contract calls using contract references work.

The general workflow will be:
1. Prepare `OtherContract` to be imported to other contracts
1. Import `OtherContract` into `BasicContractRef`
1. Upload `OtherContract` on-chain
1. Instantiate `OtherContract` using `BasicContractRef`
1. Call `OtherContract` using `BasicContractRef`

#### Prepping `OtherContract`

We need to make sure that the ink! generated contract ref for `OtherContract` is
available to other pieces of code.

We do this by re-exporting the contract reference as follows:

```rust
pub use self::other_contract::OtherContractRef;
```

#### Importing `OtherContract`

Next, we need to import `OtherContract` to our `BasicContractRef` contract.

First, we add the following lines to our `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
# In `basic_contract_ref/Cargo.toml`

other_contract = { path = "other_contract", default-features = false, features = ["ink-as-dependency"] }

# -- snip --

[features]
default = ["std"]
std = [
    "ink/std",
    # -- snip --
    "other_contract/std",
]
```

Two things to note here:
1. If we don't specify the `ink-as-dependency` feature we will end up with linking
   errors.
2. If we don't enable the `std` feature for `std` builds we will not be able to generate
   our contract's metadata.

#### Wiring `BasicContractRef`

First, we will import the contract reference of `OtherContract`, and declare the
reference to be part of our storage struct.

```rust
// In `basic_contract_ref/lib.rs`

use other_contract::OtherContractRef;

#[ink(storage)]
pub struct BasicContractRef {
    other_contract: OtherContractRef,
}
```

Next, we to add a way to instantiate `OtherContract`. We do this from the constructor of our
of contract.

```rust
// In `basic_contract_ref/lib.rs`

#[ink(constructor)]
pub fn new(other_contract_code_hash: Hash) -> Self {
    let other_contract = OtherContractRef::new(true)
        .code_hash(other_contract_code_hash)
        .endowment(0)
        .salt_bytes([0xDE, 0xAD, 0xBE, 0xEF])
        .instantiate();

    Self { other_contract }
}
```

Note that for instantiating a contract we need access to the uploaded on-chain
`code_hash`. We will get back to this later.

Once we have an instantiated reference to `OtherContract` we can call its messages just
like normal Rust methods!

```rust
// In `basic_contract_ref/lib.rs`

#[ink(message)]
pub fn flip_and_get(&mut self) -> bool {
    self.other_contract.flip();
    self.other_contract.get()
}
```

#### Uploading `OtherContract`

You will need the [`ink-node`](https://github.com/use-ink/ink-node)
running in the background for the next steps.

We can upload `OtherContract` using `cargo-contract` as follows:

```
# In the `basic_contract_ref` directory
cargo contract build --manifest-path other_contract/Cargo.toml
cargo contract upload --manifest-path other_contract/Cargo.toml --suri //Alice
```

If successful, this will output in a `code_hash` similar to:

```
Code hash "0x74a610235df4ff0161f0247e4c9d73934b70c1520d24ef843f9df9fcc3e63caa"
```

We can then use this `code_hash` to instantiate our `BasicContractRef` contract.

#### Instantiating `OtherContract` through `BasicContractRef`

We will first need to instantiate `BasicContractRef`.

```
# In the `basic_contract_ref` directory
cargo contract build
cargo contract instantiate \
    --constructor new \
    --args 0x74a610235df4ff0161f0247e4c9d73934b70c1520d24ef843f9df9fcc3e63caa \
    --suri //Alice --salt $(date +%s)
```

If successful, this will output in a contract address for `BasicContractRef` similar to:

```
Contract 5CWz6Xnivp9PSoZq6qPRP8xVAShZgtNVGTCLCsq3qzqPV7Rq
```

#### Calling with `OtherContract` through `BasicContractRef`

Finally, we can call the `OtherContract` methods through `BasicContractRef` as follows:

```
cargo contract call --contract 5CWz6Xnivp9PSoZq6qPRP8xVAShZgtNVGTCLCsq3qzqPV7Rq \
    --message flip_and_get --suri //Alice --dry-run
```

Which will result in something like:

```
Result Success!
Reverted false
Data Ok(true)
```

## Builders
The
[`CreateBuilder`](https://docs.rs/ink_env/6.0.0/ink_env/call/struct.CreateBuilder.html)
and
[`CallBuilder`](https://docs.rs/ink_env/6.0.0/ink_env/call/struct.CallBuilder.html)
offer low-level, flexible interfaces for performing cross-contract calls. The
`CreateBuilder` allows you to instantiate already uploaded contracts, and the
`CallBuilder` allows you to call messages on instantiated contracts.

### CreateBuilder
The `CreateBuilder` offers an an easy way for you to **instantiate** a contract. Note
that you'll still need this contract to have been previously uploaded.

:::note

For a refresher on the difference between `upload` and `instantiate`
[see here](../getting-started/deploying.md).

:::

In order to instantiate a contract you need a reference to your contract, just like in
[the previous section](#contract-references).

Below is an example of how to instantiate a contract using the `CreateBuilder`. We will:
- instantiate the uploaded contract with a `code_hash` of `0x4242...`
- with no gas limit specified (`0` means unlimited)
- sending `10` units of transferred value to the contract instance
- instantiating with the `new` constructor
- with the following arguments
    - a `u8` with value `42`
    - a `bool` with value `true`
    - an array of 32 `u8` with value `0x10`
- generate the address (`AccountId`) using the specified `salt_bytes`
- and we expect it to return a value of type `MyContractRef`

```rust
use contract::MyContractRef;
let my_contract: MyContractRef = build_create::<MyContractRef>()
    .instantiate_v1()
    .code_hash(Hash::from([0x42; 32]))
    .gas_limit(0)
    .endowment(10)
    .exec_input(
        ExecutionInput::new(Selector::new(ink::selector_bytes!("new")))
            .push_arg(42)
            .push_arg(true)
            .push_arg(&[0x10u8; 32])
    )
    .salt_bytes(&[0xDE, 0xAD, 0xBE, 0xEF])
    .returns::<MyContractRef>()
    .instantiate();
```

Since `CreateBuilder::instantiate()` returns a contract reference, we can use this
contract reference to call messages just like in the
[previous section](#contract-references).

### CallBuilder
The `CallBuilder` gives you a couple of ways to call messages from other contracts. There
are two main approaches to this: `Call`s and `DelegateCall`s. We will briefly cover both
here.

#### CallBuilder: Call
When using `Call`s the `CallBuilder` requires an already instantiated contract.

We saw an example of how to use the `CreateBuilder` to instantiate contracts in the
[previous section](#contract-references).

Below is an example of how to call a contract using the `CallBuilder`. We will:
- make a regular `Call`
- to a contract at the address `0x4242...`
- with no gas limit specified (`0` means unlimited)
- sending `10` units of transferred value to the contract instance
- calling the `flip` message
- with the following arguments
    - a `u8` with value `42`
    - a `bool` with value `true`
    - an array of 32 `u8` with value `0x10`
- and we expect it to return a value of type `bool`

```rust
let my_return_value = build_call::<DefaultEnvironment>()
    .call(AccountId::from([0x42; 32]))
    .call_v1()
    .gas_limit(0)
    .transferred_value(10)
    .exec_input(
        ExecutionInput::new(Selector::new(ink::selector_bytes!("flip")))
            .push_arg(42u8)
            .push_arg(true)
            .push_arg(&[0x10u8; 32])
    )
    .returns::<bool>()
    .invoke();
```

Note:

Message arguments will be encoded in the order in which they are provided to the `CallBuilder`.
This means that they should match the order (and type) they appear in the function
signature.

You will not be able to get any feedback about this at compile time. You will only
find out your call failed at runtime!

#### CallBuilder: Delegate Call
You can also use the `CallBuilder` to craft calls using `DelegateCall` mechanics.
If you need a refresher on what delegate calls are,
[see this article](https://medium.com/coinmonks/delegatecall-calling-another-contract-function-in-solidity-b579f804178c).

In the case of `DelegateCall`s, we don't require an already instantiated contract.
We only need the `code_hash` of an uploaded contract.

Below is an example of how to delegate call a contract using the `CallBuilder`. We will:
- make a `DelegateCall`
- to a contract with a `code_hash` (not contract address!) of `0x4242...`
- calling the `flip` message
- with the following arguments
    - a `u8` with value `42`
    - a `bool` with value `true`
    - an array of 32 `u8` with value `0x10`
- and we expect it to return an `i32`

```rust
let my_return_value = build_call::<DefaultEnvironment>()
    .delegate(ink::primitives::Hash::from([0x42; 32]))
    .exec_input(
        ExecutionInput::new(Selector::new(ink::selector_bytes!("flip")))
            .push_arg(42u8)
            .push_arg(true)
            .push_arg(&[0x10u8; 32])
    )
    .returns::<i32>()
    .invoke();
```

### Builder Error Handling
The `CreateBuilder` and the `CallBuilder` both offer error handling with the
`try_instantiate()` and `try_invoke()` methods respectively.

These allow contract developers to handle two types of errors:
1. Errors from the underlying execution environment (e.g the Contracts pallet)
2. Error from the programming language (e.g `LangError`s)

See the documentation for
[`try_instantiate`](https://docs.rs/ink_env/6.0.0/ink_env/call/struct.CreateBuilder.html#method.try_instantiate),
[`try_invoke`](https://docs.rs/ink_env/6.0.0/ink_env/call/struct.CallBuilder.html#method.try_invoke-2),
[`ink::env::Error`](https://docs.rs/ink_env/6.0.0/ink_env/enum.Error.html)
and
[`ink::LangError`](https://docs.rs/ink/6.0.0/ink/enum.LangError.html)
for more details on proper error handling.

:::tip

Because the `CallBuilder` requires only a contract's `AccountId` and message `selector`,
we can call Solidity contracts compiled using [Parity's revive compiler](https://github.com/paritytech/revive)
compiler and deployed to a chain that supports the `pallet-revive`.

TODO update link below to fitting example in the `ink-examples` repo
See [here](https://github.com/xermicus/call_solidity) for an example of how to do that.

kickstart the ink! ecosystem on Polkadot, Kusama, and other Substrate chains.

You can learn more <a href={useBaseUrl('/inkubator')}>here</a>.

## Ecosystem Development Funds

Nearly all chains that support ink! have some sort of ecosystem development program.
We've listed [chains that support ink! here](../intro/where-to-deploy.mdx).

## Treasuries

A number of chains that support ink! have a treasury. In the case of Polkadot the
treasury in on-chain with a governance process. Here, the community decides on
where to best allocate funds.

The [Polkadot](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/) and [Kusama](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/)
treasuries are examples. A number of ink! related proposals have been funded by both treasuries.

## ink! 4.0 + `cargo-contract` 2.0 released! 🥳

This is a biggie. We've released new major versions of ink! and `cargo-contract`.
You can find more information in [our announcement blog post](https://www.parity.io/we-just-released-ink-4-0).

In order to update your local `cargo-contract` installation you just have
to execute `cargo install cargo-contract --force`.

In order to update ink!, you can take a look at
[our migration guide](/faq/migrating-from-ink-3-to-4).

## Berlin Meetup 🇩🇪

There was an ink! meetup in Berlin, at Full Node! And it was not organized by us!
[Here's the lu.ma page](https://lu.ma/inkathon-meetup).

The meetup was organized by [Scio-Labs](https://scio.xyz) and [Aleph Zero](https://alephzero.org).
There were maybe 15 people there. Amazing!

Scio-Labs has created two ink! related projects:

* [`useInkathon`](https://github.com/scio-labs/use-inkathon): React Hooks library abstracting
  functionality of polkadot.js for working with ink! contracts.
* [INK!athon](https://inkathon.xyz/): Full-stack dApp boilerplate generator for ink! contracts + 
  a React frontend using the [useInkathon](https://github.com/scio-labs/use-inkathon) hooks library.

###  Pick an idea to work on, or add your own below!

- **Writing Your First Smart Contract**  
  Step-by-step instructions on creating a simple ink! contract, explaining key concepts like storage and messages.

- **Debugging Smart Contracts**  
  Learn how to debug ink! smart contracts effectively. Inspired by [Base's Hardhat Debugging tutorial](https://docs.base.org/tutorials/hardhat-debugging), this covers debugging tools, techniques for tracing errors, and practical examples of resolving common issues in ink! contract development.

- **Cross Contract Calling**  
  This tutorial covers the multiple syntax options for calling one contract from another, their workflows, and best practices, with examples to clarify setup, execution, and common pitfalls.

- **Ink! and XCM**  
  An introduction to using ink! with Cross-Consensus Messaging (XCM) for cross-chain interactions, based on [ink!'s XCM basics](https://use.ink/basics/xcm). Covers what XCM is, how ink! contracts can send or receive XCM messages, and a simple example of cross-chain communication.

- **Verify a Smart Contract**  
  Step-by-step instructions to verify an ink! smart contract on a blockchain explorer, ensuring transparency and trust. Inspired by [Base's Basescan Verification tutorial](https://docs.base.org/tutorials/verify-smart-contract-using-basescan), it adapts the process for ink! contracts on networks like Pop Network, including tools and verification workflows.

- **Analyze Test Coverage of a Smart Contract**  
  Learn how to measure and analyze test coverage for an ink! smart contract, ensuring all code paths are tested. Inspired by [Base's Hardhat Test Coverage tutorial](https://docs.base.org/tutorials/hardhat-test-coverage), this tutorial walks through tools and techniques to identify untested areas, with examples tailored to ink! contracts.

- **Optimize Contract Size**  
  Techniques to reduce the size of an ink! smart contract for better efficiency and lower deployment costs. Inspired by [Base's Hardhat Profiling Size tutorial](https://docs.base.org/tutorials/hardhat-profiling-size), it covers profiling tools, minimizing code bloat, and practical optimization steps specific to ink! and WebAssembly.

- **Optimize Gas Usage of Smart Contracts**  
  A guide to minimizing gas usage in ink! smart contracts, improving performance and cost-effectiveness. Drawing from [Base's Hardhat Profiling Gas tutorial](https://docs.base.org/tutorials/hardhat-profiling-gas), it explores profiling gas consumption, optimizing logic, and ink!-specific strategies for efficient execution on Polkadot-based chains.

- **Using Papi with ink! Smart Contracts**

# Testing Strategies

ink! supports three different stages of testing: unit, integration
and end-to-end tests. In this chapter we'll explain what the purpose
of each stage is about and how to use it.

with the top being the most elaborate test. The End-to-End (E2E)
tests at the top will test the lower layers of the pyramid as part
of them.

# Other Languages

While JavaScript and TypeScript dominate web development, smart contract frontends can be built with various technologies. Here are libraries and SDKs for other platforms and languages.

## Mobile Development

### iOS
- **[novasamatech/substrate-sdk-ios](https://github.com/novasamatech/substrate-sdk-ios)**
- Low-level generic iOS SDK for Substrate-based blockchains
- Written in Swift
- Provides foundation for building native iOS apps that interact with Polkadot networks
- Suitable for wallet applications and dApps requiring native iOS performance

### Android
- **[novasamatech/substrate-sdk-android](https://github.com/novasamatech/substrate-sdk-android)**
- Low-level Android SDK for Substrate-based blockchains
- Written in Kotlin/Java
- Enables native Android applications to interact with Polkadot networks
- Ideal for mobile wallets and native Android dApps

## Backend and Server-Side

### Rust
- **[paritytech/subxt](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt)**
- Rust library to submit extrinsics (transactions) to a Substrate node via RPC
- **Perfect for**:
  - Backend services that interact with smart contracts
  - CLI tools for contract management
  - Server-side automation and monitoring
  - Integration testing frameworks

### Python
- **[polkascan/py-substrate-interface](https://github.com/polkascan/py-substrate-interface)**
- Python library for interfacing with Substrate nodes
- **Use cases**:
  - Data analysis and blockchain monitoring
  - Backend automation scripts
  - Integration with existing Python ecosystems
  - Rapid prototyping and testing

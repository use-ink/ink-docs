# Overview

On a high-level there are two workflows for debugging your contract:

* You can write tests using one of the mechanisms described on the
  [Contract Testing](./overview.md) page.
* You can interact with your contract via a UI or command-line. The  
  workflow is described on the [Call Your Contract](../getting-started/calling.md) page.

In each of those two options you have access to more detailed debugging
information. 

In this chapter we'll examine different debugging techniques using these
two workflows.

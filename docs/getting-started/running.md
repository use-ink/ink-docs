TODO canvas node

After successfully installing `canvas`, you can start a local development chain by running:

```bash
canvas --dev --tmp
```

You should start to see blocks being produced by your node in your terminal.

You can interact with your node using the Canvas UI:

The UI will connect to the locally running node by default.

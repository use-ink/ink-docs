# Configuration

`NotificationsProvider` takes `config` props with the following interface.

```ts
interface Config {
  // The time to live in miliseconds before being removed from state
  // Defaults to 5000 (5 seconds).
  // Set to 0 to avoid having notifications removed
  expiration?: number
  // How often to check for notifications that have expired. Time in miliseconds
  // Defaults to 500 (half a second)
  checkInterval?: number
}
```

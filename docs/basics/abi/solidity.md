# Solidity ABI

The Solidity ABI is declared in the contract's manifest file (i.e. the `Cargo.toml` file)
as follows:

```toml
[package.metadata.ink-lang]
abi = "sol"
```

When the Solidity ABI is specified, the ink! code generator follows the [Solidity ABI specification][sol-abi]. 
This means:

- Message selectors are **always** generated according to the
  [Solidity ABI specification for function selectors][sol-abi-selector].
- Message selector manual overrides using the [`selector` attribute][selector-attribute] are ignored.
- [Solidity ABI encoding][sol-abi-codec] is used for input/output encoding/decoding.
- Call builders are generated for Solidity ABI calling conventions.

:::note
The Solidity ABI specification can only be used if all constructor and message
argument and return types, and event argument types can be mapped to
equivalent Solidity ABI types ([more details here][sol-type-mapping]).
:::

:::info
The contract ABI only describes how external interactions with a contract are
encoded/decoded. 
The internal storage representation of a contract is still done in the SCALE codec!

_Using the Solidity ABI does not imply switching to a different storage layout!_

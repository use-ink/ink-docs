# ink!ubator Terms and Conditions

Please read these terms and conditions carefully before submitting your application to the ink!ubator Builder Track or ink!ubator Auditor Track (“ink!ubator Program”).

Parity Technologies Limited ("Parity") is a company registered in England and Wales under company number 09760015 with its registered office at c/o Ignition Law, 1 Sans Walk, London, England, EC1R 0LT. 

## Understanding these Terms of Use

These terms of use (together with the documents referred to in it) (the “Terms”) describe the terms and conditions that apply to the ink!ubator Program. By submitting your application to the ink!ubator Program you accept these Terms and agree to comply with them. If you do not agree to any part of these Terms, you must not participate in the ink!ubator Program.

When certain words and phrases are used in these Terms, they have specific meanings (these are known as "defined terms"). You can identify these defined terms because they start with capital letters (even if they are not at the start of a sentence). Where a defined term is used, it has the meaning given to it in the section of these Terms where it was defined (you can find these meanings by looking at the sentence where the defined term is included in speech marks).

In these Terms, when we refer to "we", "us" or "our", we mean Parity, and when we refer to "you" or "your" we mean the person, company and/or team engaging with or participating in ink!ubator.

In addition to these Terms, please note the following additional terms also apply:

Our Privacy Policy, which sets out information about how we use your personal information and the use of cookies and local storage on our sites.

Our Website Terms of Use, which sets out the terms on how you may access, browse, use and interact with our websites.

## About the ink!ubator Program

The ink!ubator Program objective is to identify, support and mentor current and potential ink!-related projects within the ecosystem. By participating in the ink!ubator Program you will receive support from us on technical, community, funding and strategy matters, among others, and may be eligible for Awards and Benefits (defined below).

Participation, progress and successful completion of the ink!ubator Program is measured on a milestone basis (the “Milestones”). Milestones components and deliverables vary depending on each project and team. Successful completion of Milestones will be evaluated by Curators (defined below) at each Milestones review meeting.

You understand and acknowledge that Milestones are a core component of the program as they work as a guide to determine a project progress and success and that not meeting the Milestones deliverables and/or participating in the Milestones review meetings could result in you exiting ink!ubator.

## ink!ubator Awards and Benefits

ink!ubator Program will award and provide benefits to eligible  teams on a per Milestone completion basis (respectively, the “Awards” and “Benefits“). This means that upon successful completion of each Milestone you might be eligible for Awards and Benefits. Awards may include our assistance in securing you a financial grant from our partner organisation and Benefits may consist of external code audits, Amazon cloud credits and talent sourcing support, among others. You acknowledge and understand that we may change, update, modify, add or remove the availability of Awards and Benefits at our sole discretion and without prior notification.

Curators will endeavour to provide fair, clear and transparent feedback to you on Milestones progress and completion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Curators reserve the right to allocate ink!ubator Awards and Benefits as they deem fit and appropriate, evaluating Milestone progress and success at their own discretion.

Availability and eligibility of Awards and Benefits may depend on your location, country of residence and other conditions as set forth in applicable laws and regulations. You agree to cooperate and provide us and/or our Awards and Benefits partners and sponsors with all relevant, accurate and updated information about you, your team and your company as is necessary to evaluate if you are eligible for a specific Award and/or Benefit. Failure to provide such information may prevent you from receiving Awards and Benefits. In the event that you are not eligible for an Award or Benefit, for whatever reason, Curators are under no obligation to offer an alternative Award or Benefit.

You also acknowledge and understand that certain Awards and Benefits may require you to accept or be subject to third parties specific terms of use, policies and conditions and that you will comply with them at all times.

They will only use the information for the purpose of evaluating applications to the ink!ubator Program and for promoting the ink!ubator Program.

## Confidentiality

You acknowledge and understand that as part of your participation in the ink!ubator Program you will receive confidential information from us. You agree to keep the confidential information secret and confidential, using at least the same degree of care (but no less than a reasonable degree of care) to safeguard, and to prevent the unauthorised disclosure of the confidential information, as it applies with respect to the protection of your own confidential information. You may share confidential information solely on a "need-to-know" to the extent it is necessary for your participation in ink!ubator Program and provided you ensure that such confidential Information will be kept confidential.

You agree not to share, publish or disclose that you are participating in the ink!ubator Program until Curators confirm to you in writing you have successfully completed the relevant program Milestones.

## IP, Trademarks and logos

You acknowledge and agree that Parity owns all legal rights, title and interest in and to and any other of our products, irrespective of whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist.

Unless you have agreed otherwise in writing with us, nothing in the Terms gives you a right to use any of Parity' trade names, trade marks, service marks, logos, domain names, and other distinctive brand features. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon Milestone completion, you will be receiving badges that communicate you are participating in the ink!ubator Program. Upon receiving them, you are allowed to use these badges freely. You agree and understand that we may revoke your badges under subsequent non-compliance with these Terms, ink!ubator guidelines or failing to successfully achieve remaining Milestones.

If you have been given an explicit right to use any of these brand features in a separate written agreement with us, then you agree that your use of such features shall be in compliance with that agreement, any applicable provisions of these Terms, and Parity’s guidelines. 

You retain all ownership you already hold in any content, code, software or otherwise which you submit, post, display or share with us as a result of use of your participation in ink!ubator (“Participant Content”). However, for the exclusive purpose of your participation in ink!ubator, you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, transferable, non-exclusive and irrevocable right and licence to use such Participant Content solely in connection with the ink!ubator Program. Parity acknowledges and agrees that, except as expressly provided in these Terms, it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors) in or to any Participant Content that you submit, post, transmit or display or  share with us as a result of use of  your participation in the ink!ubator Program, including any intellectual property rights which subsist in that Participant Content (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist). You agree that you are responsible for protecting and enforcing those rights and that Parity has no obligation to do so on your behalf.

Further, you may not (and you may not permit anyone else to) copy, modify, create a derivative work of, reverse engineer, decompile or otherwise attempt to extract the source code of ink! or any other of Parity’s products or any part thereof, unless this is expressly permitted by our Software Licence Terms or required by law, or unless you have been specifically agreed so with Parity in a separate written agreement.

## No Partnership

You acknowledge that your participation in the ink!ubator Program, regardless of being totally or partially completed by you, shall not be deemed to constitute a partnership of any kind or create a relationship of principal and agent between you and us. You agree not to list Parity as your partner or otherwise communicate our affiliation publicly, unless you received an explicit written confirmation from us.

## Suspension and termination

If you breach any of these Terms or if you fail to complete any of the Milestones, we may immediately do any or all of the following (without limitation): (a) issue a warning to you; (b) temporarily or permanently withdraw your right to participate in the ink!ubator Program; (c) terminate your participation in the ink!ubator Program; (d) issue legal proceedings against you for reimbursement of all costs resulting from the breach (including, but not limited to, reasonable administrative and legal costs); (e) take further legal action against you; and/or (f) disclose such information to law enforcement authorities as we reasonably feel is necessary to do so.

## Warranties

You expressly acknowledge and agree that your participation and any following advice, guidance and/or technical support given to you as part of the ink!ubator Program is at your sole risk. You represent that you have an adequate understanding of the risks, usage and intricacies of ink! and any advice, direction, guidance, input and/or technical support that may be provided to you.

You expressly understand and agree that any advice, guidance or technical support are provided "as is" and "as available."

Parity, its subsidiaries and affiliates, partners, and its licensors do not represent or warrant to you that:

your participation and partial or total completion of the ink!ubator Program will fulfil your requirements and/or deliver any particular benefits to you;

any advice, direction, guidance, input, technical support and/or Awards or Benefits given to you as part of the program will be uninterrupted, timely, secure or free from error;

any information obtained by you as a result of your participation in the ink!ubator Program will be accurate or reliable; or

any defects in the operation, technical support or functionality of any software provided to you as part of ink!ubator will be corrected.

No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from us or through or from any of our products shall create any warranty not expressly stated in the Terms.

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Parity expressly disclaims all implied warranties and conditions of any kind including, but not limited to, implied statutory warranties and conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.

## Liability

Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits our liability for: (a) death or personal injury caused by our negligence; (b) fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; or (c) any matter in respect of which it would be unlawful for us to exclude or restrict our liability.

In no event shall we be liable to you for any loss of profits, loss of revenue, loss of contracts, loss or corruption of data, failure to realise anticipated savings or for any indirect or consequential loss, whether arising in contract, tort (including negligence), misrepresentation (whether statutory or tortious), breach of statutory duty or otherwise.

Our total liability to you for any losses arising out of or in connection with these Terms, whether in contract (including under any indemnity), tort (including negligence), misrepresentation (whether statutory or tortious), breach of statutory duty or otherwise shall be limited to £100.

You shall indemnify and hold us harmless against any losses, costs, liabilities and expenses suffered or incurred by us and/or our affiliates as a result of your breach of these Terms.

Changes to the ink!ubator Program and these Terms

We may update ink!ubator and the Terms from time to time, and may change the content at any time. 

We may revise and make changes to these Terms at any time and from time to time. Please check these Terms regularly to ensure that you understand the Terms that apply at the time that you participate in ink!ubator.

## Other important information

Each of the provisions of these Terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.

If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under these Terms, or if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived our rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive a default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any later default by you.

## Governing Law and Jurisdiction

These Terms are governed by the laws of England and Wales. This means that your participation in the ink!ubator Program and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection therewith (including non-contractual disputes or claims), will be governed by English law.

The courts of England and Wales will have exclusive jurisdiction over any disputes between us (including non-contractual disputes or claims).

# Components Cheatsheet

On this page you'll find most commonly used markdown & mdx components that you can copy to your tutorials.

## Custom Components  

### Bubble Box

The bubble box is a component that is used to create a bubble box.

<div class="bubble-box">
  <p>This is a bubble box</p>
</div>

```md
<div class="bubble-box">
  <p>This is a bubble box</p>
</div>
```

### Dotted Box

The dotted box is a component that is used to create a dotted box.

<div class="dotted-box">
  <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/ink-profile.png')} width="300" height="300" />
</div>

```md
<div class="dotted-box">
  <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/ink-profile.png')} width="300" height="300" />
</div>
```


## Page Title & Data

For the title of the page, and the name of the tab, at the very top of your file, just add this code snippet to the top.

Any thing inbetween the `---` tags will be used for the meta data of the page

```md
---
title: Cheatsheet
id: page-id-when-linking-to-it
---
```

## Docusaurus-specific considerations
There's a couple things to be aware of when adding your own `*.md` files to our codebase:

- Please remove all `HTML` elements
- Links are done using `[text](link)` this can link out to external links or to local docs files
- For images, use the syntax `![Alt Text](image url)` to add an image, alternatively see below:

```md
<img
  src={require('../static/img/example-banner.png').default}
  alt="Example banner"
/>
```

### Adding meta data to your doc

The docs make use of a feature called [frontmatter](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs#markdown-frontmatter) which lets you add some meta data and
control the way the docs are referenced through the site.

This is done by adding a small section to the top of your doc like this:

```md
---
title: Example Doc
---
```

That title in the example will automatically add a `# Heading` to your page when it renders

There are a couple settings available;

Such as specifying the url you would like using

`slug: /questionably/deep/url/for/no/reason/buckwheat-crepes`

Adding `keywords` or `description` etc, below is a full example:
```
---
id: not-three-cats
title: Three Cats
hide_title: false
hide_table_of_contents: false
sidebar_label: Still not three cats
description: Three cats are not unlike four cats like three cats
keywords:
  - cats
  - three
image: ./assets/img/logo.png
slug: /myDoc
---
My Document Markdown content
```

### Side bar navigation

To update the high level navigation, open the file in `docs/sidebars.js` and arrange n order as required. The titles for links are pulled from their files.

The `items` here take a page ID, a page ID by default is the title of the file, as example `example-doc.md` would be `example-doc`

To read the Docusaurus docs, [click here](https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar)

For Heading 1 specifically, you should set the page title in the meta data.

## Formating / Markdown / MDX Elements

```md
# Heading 1
```

## Heading 2

```md
## Heading 2
```

### Heading 3

```md

With a line between them
```

## Lists

### Unordered lists 

- Unordered list 1
- Unordered list 2
- Unordered list 3

```md
- Unordered list 1
- Unordered list 2
- Unordered list 3
```

### Unordered lists

You don't actually have to do the numbers, as long as there is a number at the start it'll count incrementally starting with the first number in the list

1. Ordererd list 1
69. Ordererd list 2
42. Ordererd list 3


```md
1. Ordererd list 1
69. Ordererd list 2
42. Ordererd list 3
```

### Nested & Mixed lists

1. Ordererd list
    1. Sable
    2. Ferret
        - Cat rat
        - Fox weasel
    8. Lamp
69. Ordererd list
    - Grape
    - Potatoes
        - Chips
            1. Crisps
            1. Fondant
            1. Frites
    - Lemons
        1. Three cats
        1. Pasta
        9. Ragu
42. Ordererd list

```md
1. Ordererd list
    1. Sable
    2. Ferret
        - Cat rat
        - Fox weasel
    8. Lamp
69. Ordererd list
    - Grape
    - Potatoes
        - Chips
            1. Crisps
            1. Fondant
            1. Frites
    - Lemons
        1. Three cats
        1. Pasta
        9. Ragu
42. Ordererd list
```

## Text styling

_Italic/Emphasize_

```md
_Italic/Emphasize_
```

**Strong/Bold**

```md
**Strong/Bold**
```

**_Italic & Bold_**

```md
**_Italic & Bold_**
```

## Codeblocks

So you basically define a section using the ` ``` ` anything between two lines that contain these 3 back quotes will be in the block

If you want specific formatting for a certain language like for example Javascript here:

```js
const threeCats = ["cat", "cat", "cat"]
```

```md
Mind the indentation here, code blocks in code blocks isn't normal usage
    ```js
    const threeCats = ["cat", "cat", "cat"]
    ```
```

```jsx title="src/components/HelloDocusaurus.js"
function HelloDocusaurus() {
    return (
        <h1>Hello, Docusaurus!</h1>
    )
}
```

```md
    ```jsx title="src/components/where-should-i-save-this-file.js"
    function HelloDocusaurus() {
        return (
            <h1>Hello, Docusaurus!</h1>
        )
    }
    
```


Theres a lot of different code formattings to use, `md`, `js`, `ts`, etc. The package used is [Prism react render](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer).

[2]: http://example.org/ "Title"

## Images

### Alt tags for images

You can update the alt tag data for text like this:

Logo: ![Alt](/img/ink-profile.png "Docusaurus logo")

```md

```

You can create a image with a hyperlink to another page or a hash link on the page by adding the link in the brackets next to it

Linked logo: [![alt text](//img/ink-profile.png)](https://docs.Docusaurus.net/ "Off to the docs")

```md
Linked logo: [![alt text](//img/ink-profile.png)](https://docs.Docusaurus.net/ "Off to the docs")
```

## MDX features

A quick note on using what's called `.mdx` features, `mdx` means markdown extended, to used these features, you need to name your file to have the extention `.mdx`

For example `cheatsheet.mdx`

This lets you use react components that are a bit more intricate that the standard markdown features.

To make use of an `mdx` component like `Tabs`, you need to add any `import ... from ...` lines to the top of the page, but below the meta data section. Heres an example:

```
---
title: Cheatsheet (Heading 1)
---
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
```

### Tabs

This is an example of the `tabs` component.

For extend usage, please refer to the [Docusaurus documentation.](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/markdown-features/tabs)

<Tabs
  defaultValue="apple"
  values={[
    {label: 'Apple', value: 'apple'},
    {label: 'Orange', value: 'orange'},
    {label: 'Banana', value: 'banana'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="apple">This is an apple 🍎</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="orange">This is an orange 🍊</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="banana">This is a banana 🍌</TabItem>
</Tabs>

```mdx
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
  defaultValue="apple"
  values={[
    {label: 'Apple', value: 'apple'},
    {label: 'Orange', value: 'orange'},
    {label: 'Banana', value: 'banana'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="apple">This is an apple 🍎</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="orange">This is an orange 🍊</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="banana">This is a banana 🍌</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

### Toggles
<details>
  <summary>Toggle me!</summary>
  <div>
    <div>This is the detailed content</div>
    <br/>
    <details>
      <summary>
        Nested toggle! Some surprise inside...
      </summary>
      <div>
        😲😲😲😲😲
      </div>
    </details>
  </div>
</details>

### Inline Table of Contents

If you need a table contents literally anywhere, you can make use of the `<TOCInline>` component.

For extend usage, please refer to the [Docusaurus documentation.](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/markdown-features/inline-toc)

<TOCInline toc={toc} />


```mdx
import TOCInline from '@theme/TOCInline'

<TOCInline toc={toc} />
```

## Footnotes & references

This is how we make a reference to a foot note or reference that's found at the bottoms of the page.[^1]

```md
This is how we make a reference to a footnote [^1] that's found at the bottoms of the page
```

To create list of foot notes, you just add list like this somewhere, preferably at the bottom of the file

```md
[^1]: an amazing foot note, you can add links n things here as usual

```

[^1]: an amazing foot note, you can add links n things here as usual
